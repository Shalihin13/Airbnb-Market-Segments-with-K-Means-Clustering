✅ Objectives
🔍 Understand listing patterns and segment them into distinct clusters

🧠 Provide business insights for Airbnb stakeholders (pricing, engagement, location)

🛠️ Build an end-to-end clustering pipeline including preprocessing, modeling, visualization and Build an interactive web with Streamlit


Result : 

CLuster 0 🔴 = Populer
This Cluster represents properties with affordable prices but high occupancy rates. Listings in this cluster perform very well in terms of number of reviews and rental frequency, indicating high appeal among budget travelers.

CLuster 1 🟡 = Dormant
This cluster reflects listings with low rental activity. This is likely due to lack of visibility, less competitive pricing, or less strategic location.

Cluster 2 🔵 = Premium
This Cluster consists of exclusive property listings with higher rental rates and high availability. Targeting the upper-end market segment with a preference for comfort and quality of service.
