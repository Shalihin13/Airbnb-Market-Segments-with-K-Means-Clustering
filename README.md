# Airbnb-Market Segments with K-Means Clustering

🧾 Introduction

Airbnb.com, a global company engaged in the short-term rental of accommodations, that connects property owners (hosts) with guests looking for accommodation.
With increasing competition and the need for personalized service,  it is important to understand the types or segments of listings available on their platform. 

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to segment Airbnb listings in New York City using unsupervised machine learning techniques (mainly K-Means Clustering)

✅ Objectives

🔍 Understand listing patterns and segment them into distinct clusters

🧠 Provide business insights for Airbnb stakeholders (pricing, engagement)

🛠️ Build an easy-to-use interface with Streamlit that can predict cluster  characteristics in real time

✅ Goals
- Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Implement K-Means clustering and evaluate with silhouette score
- Apply scaling and dimensionality reduction
- Interpret and visualize each cluster
- Build an interactive dashboard with Streamlit
  
Result : 

CLuster 0 🔴 = Populer

This Cluster represents properties with affordable prices but high occupancy rates. Listings in this cluster perform very well in terms of number of reviews and rental frequency, indicating high appeal among budget travelers.

CLuster 1 🟡 = Dormant 

This cluster reflects listings with low rental activity. This is likely due to lack of visibility, less competitive pricing, or less strategic location.

Cluster 2 🔵 = Premium 

This Cluster consists of exclusive property listings with higher rental rates and high availability. Targeting the upper-end market segment with a preference for comfort and quality of service.
